# My Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website.

Let me know if there are things I could improve on :)

**Note:** Portfolio section is for future purpose, therefore, it is only there for aesthetic purposes currently.

 ## Current Bugs:
 - Space at the bottom (desktop)
 - The current project section is formatted incorrectly. Image and text on one side instead of separate (mobile)

 ## Things to consider:
 - Remove percentages and bars from skills section.
 - Add socials(kaggle/leetcode/etc.)
